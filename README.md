It highlights revenue trends, customer segments, and product-level insights through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that support business decision-making and performance tracking.
 ### Objectives
 - To analyze sales and revenue performance across product categories and customer segments.
- To identify the most profitable products and regions driving revenue growth.
- To evaluate customer behavior patterns such as order frequency and return rates.
- To measure overall performance metrics (revenue, orders, returns, profit) and track trends over time.
- To develop an interactive Power BI report that provides decision-makers with clear, actionable insights.
